This is a crypto airdrop type project. It has a dynamic user interface. It uses browser router, react router dom, routes, metamask and all other dependencies. Background images, hover-effect, animated cards, grid system are used for attractive user interface. It is made responsive by using media query for every screen size, devices.

Dependencies:
These are prebuilt libraries. They are used to save time and speed up the development process. They are directly installed in the package.js file. React router is used to load a specific component; it prevents the entire page from loading. Route gives the path to the component which helps in knowing the component to be rendered. Browser router is used to enable all these. Meta mask dependency is used which helps in connecting to metamask. In this we can do transactions from metamask wallet.

Animated card/hover-effect:
Hover effect is a CSS property which increases the visibility of buttons or specific buttons in the card and where the cursor goes. Animated cards are made from this.

Grid system:
Grid system defines the column and row in the web page. It defines the size of a card or container. This is a powerful module. Using which you can achieve responsiveness without using too much CSS. There are 12 columns inside the page and we can take rows as per requirement.

Media-Query:
It is a CSS property which helps in making the app responsive for all devices. In this, we can change the size, color and other CSS properties by giving specific card, navbar, ClassName and many other things as per minimum width or maximum width screen size.
